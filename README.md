# Numerical Methods: Computational Physics

Simple MATLAB implementations of common numerical methods used in physics.

**These scripts were written as a part of my role as a teaching assistant for the course PHY F313 Computational Physics at BITS Pilani.**

Each script has a detailed description at the beginning. Each script also has a corresponding run_{name}.m with simple example to run the function.

`This is a work in progress. All the scripts will be added soon.`

## Contents
1. [Jacobi Method](https://github.com/jainkhyati/computational-physics/tree/main/jacobi): determines the solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations.
2. [Deflation and Power method](https://github.com/jainkhyati/computational-physics/tree/main/deflation-power): calulates eigen values and vectors of a real matrix using Hotelling Deflation method. Power method finds the largest eigen vector of the given matrix
